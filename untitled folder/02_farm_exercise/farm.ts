/*Exercise :
We will give you the first type, the root interface that defines a Farm. Notice how we refer to different types Animal & FarmBuilding here, it is up to you to implement them.

interface Farm {
  animals: Animal[];
  buildings: FarmBuilding[];
  farmName: string;
}
üìù Exercise: Define the Animal and FarmBuilding types. You can be creative but make sure that:

Animal has a property named kind (string) and id (number)
FarmBuilding has a property shelters that hold an array of strings that determine what kind of animal can go in it.
After we created our types, let's use them to create a farm

üìù Exercise: Use the types you just created to create a variable of type Farm. It should have 5 animals and 3 building minimum.

Now we will write some functions to manage the farm

üìù Exercise: Create the following functions to manage the farm".

A function to removeAnimal that removes an animal from the farm based on id
A function to addAnimal that adds an animal to the farm
A function to checkShelters that returns a boolean indicating if all the kinds of animals have shelter
